## 📖 Introduction

**Tablé** is a Location-Based Service (LBS) data-driven platform designed for real-time dining and dynamic yield management. 

Operating as a two-sided marketplace, Tablé bridges the gap between spontaneous diners seeking immediate seating and restaurants experiencing unexpected operational lulls. By leveraging real-time geospatial search, transit-validated ETA guardrails, and Machine Learning-driven 1-to-1 flash deal matching, Tablé protects brand equity while efficiently filling empty seats and significantly reducing queue times for urban diners.

## 🌟 Core MVP Highlights

- 📍 **Geospatial Discovery**
  Acquires real-time user location to accurately display premium restaurants with immediate table availability within a strictly defined `1.5km` radius.
- ⏱️ **Transit-Validated Booking (ETA Guardrails)**
  Integrates the Google Distance Matrix API to dynamically calculate Estimated Time of Arrival (ETA). It ensures users can physically arrive before the restaurant's reservation hold window expires, effectively mitigating "no-shows".
- ⚡ **Lull-Mitigation Trigger (Flash Deals)**
  A B-suite dashboard feature allowing restaurant managers to convert empty tables into exclusive 1-to-1 flash deals with a single click. These offers are pushed secretly to the most compatible nearby diners via our recommendation algorithms, avoiding public mass discounting.
